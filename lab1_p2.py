#2. Write a program to multiply and divide two numbers.

a = int(input('Enter the  Number a :'))
b = int(input('Enter the  Number b :'))
mul = a * b
dev = a / b
print(f'The multiplications of a and b is : {mul}')
print(f'The devision of a and b is : {dev}')
#It will print Multiplication and devision of two numbers
